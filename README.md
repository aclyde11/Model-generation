# Model-generation
Python scripts to generate an MD-ready model from smiles strings

Currently everything can be run by importing interface_functions and calling GetMetrics(smiles,method).
Methods can be 'dock', 'minimize' and 'mmgbsa'

Need to make this into a command line executable with the appropriate options
